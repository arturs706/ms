# Rust Axum Microservices

This repository contains a collection of microservices built using the Rust programming language and the Axum web framework. These microservices are designed to demonstrate various features and best practices for building scalable and efficient web applications with Rust.

## Features

- **Axum Framework**: Utilizes the Axum web framework, which is a high-performance, ergonomic web framework built on top of Tokio and Tower.
- **Microservices Architecture**: Each microservice is designed to be modular and independent, showcasing the principles of microservices architecture.
- **RESTful APIs**: Implements RESTful APIs for communication between microservices, promoting interoperability and ease of integration.
- **Database Integration**: Demonstrates integration with various databases commonly used in Rust web development, such as PostgreSQL etc.
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Leverages asynchronous processing capabilities provided by Tokio to handle concurrent requests efficiently.
- **Docker Support**: Includes Dockerfiles for containerization, facilitating deployment and scalability.
- **Configuration Management**: Illustrates techniques for managing configurations in Rust applications, supporting different environments (e.g., development, testing, production).
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Implements logging and monitoring solutions to aid in debugging and performance optimization.
- **Security**: Incorporates security best practices, such as input validation, authentication, and authorization mechanisms.
- **Testing**: Provides comprehensive testing suites, including unit tests, integration tests, and possibly property-based testing, to ensure the reliability and correctness of the microservices.

**Note**: This repository is in the early stage of development and it is part of a university project dissertation at the University of West London (UWL).
